# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using **Machine Learning** techniques. It uses a dataset with various medical attributes and applies classification algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** `heart.csv`
- **Features Include:**
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Resting Blood Pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Resting ECG
  - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
  - Exercise Induced Angina
  - ST Depression (oldpeak)
  - Slope of peak exercise ST segment
  - Number of major vessels
  - Thalassemia
  - Target (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for Data Manipulation
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** for Data Visualization
- **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)** for Machine Learning Models and Evaluation Metrics

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Performance Metric:** Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **Confusion Matrix** for evaluating model predictions.
- **Accuracy Score** to determine overall performance.
- **Heatmap Visualization** of the confusion matrix using Seaborn.

---

## 💻 How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Ensure you have the `heart.csv` dataset in the same directory.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells step by step.

---

## 🎁 Output Example
- Model accuracy displayed in the notebook.
- Confusion matrix plotted with a heatmap for visual evaluation of predictions.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try different ML models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
